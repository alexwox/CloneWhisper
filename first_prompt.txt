I want to build a mac whisper clone called clonewhisper using: 
- Electron
- Elevenlabs api 

Workflow (Mac): 
- User presses and holds keybinding / shortcut
- While holding, the app takes in microphone output (asks for permission if first time) 
- Shows a small indicator over the active field that there is a recording (like mac whisperer)
- If no active field: Show "No active field, copying to clipboard"

In the future I want to add: 
- In the electron app a textfield that takes a context string
- This context is sent along with the microphone input to ElevenLabs API to improve the transcription

Give me a step by step implementation plan to get this started, with checklist and labels what I need to do vs what Cursor can do for me.
